# Know

A knowledge API for complex queries with traceability and human interpretability. Think of it as a fusion between LLMs (which answer complex questions) and Git (which models representational change).

## Why Symbolic AI Matters

Neural networks excel at perception and pattern recognition but fail where we need them most:

- **Explainability** — Black box decisions can't be debugged or audited
- **Logic** — Neural nets approximate reasoning but don't guarantee correctness
- **Reliability** — High-stakes domains (law, medicine, finance) require deterministic reasoning
- **Data efficiency** — Rules generalize without massive datasets
- **Truth maintenance** — Symbolic systems avoid hallucinations through validated knowledge

**The solution:** Neuro-symbolic AI combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning.

## Approach

Build a concept map in digital geometric space that humans and AI share. When humans can inspect the conceptual structure, AI results become debuggable, citable, and trustworthy.

Unlike embedding models—which produce opaque high-dimensional vectors—Know's geometric space provides human-interpretable conceptual relationships. Similarity through geometry, meaning through structure.

## Applications

**RAG Pipeline Accuracy** — Solve retrieval intelligence problems: finding precise knowledge, recognizing gaps, handling distributed information across large documents, synthesizing cross-document insights.

**Research Tool** — Built-in explainability and interoperability. "What sources make this answer true?" becomes trivially answerable. Nearby concepts are immediately explorable.

**Codebase Mapping** — Improve AI coding agents by accurately mapping code concepts, enabling better search, understanding, and targeted changes in large codebases.

**News & Policy Mapping** — Track how legislation or court hearings impact your business by mapping conceptual relationships over time.

**Personalized Learning Maps** — Map an individual's conceptual understanding to create personalized learning paths. By visualizing knowledge gaps and connections in a learner's mental model, Know enables adaptive education tailored to each person's unique cognitive structure.
